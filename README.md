### Hi 👋
My name is Nickolas Ferreti, but you can call me Ferreti, i'm 21 years old and i have a passion for technology since i was 13 years old.
My principal focus right now is in back-end, but i have experience in front-end too, i'm currently in my computer science graduation in the fourth phase.
A fun fact about me is in the past then i I didn't like programming even if they paid me, but since then, i started having more and more contact with technology and computer programing, and now that's my main job basically 24/7, studying and trying to do my best to learn new ways to improve my code and my knowledge about it.
